# Skin Lesion Classification Using AI Tools

This project explores the use of multiple AI-based tools to build a skin cancer classification model from dermatoscopic images. The focus is on differentiating benign lesions (nevus) from malignant ones (melanoma), using both real and synthetically generated data. The goal is to evaluate how generative AI can contribute across stages of a typical medical imaging pipeline: code generation, data augmentation, and documentation.

## üìÅ Repository Contents

The repository contains the following Python scripts:

- `claude_ham10000_binary_classifier.py`: Model training script generated by Claude.
- `deepseek_ham10000_binary_classifier.py`: Improved DeepSeek-generated script with normalization removed.
- `old_deepseek_ham10000_bin_classifier.py`: Original DeepSeek script before corrections.
- `dataset_inference_annotation.py`: Prepares metadata for synthetic images generated by Dreamina.
- `inference_artificial_dataset.py`: Performs inference on Dreamina-generated images using the best-performing model.

Additionally, the repository includes:

- `melanoma_classifier_fixed.h5`: The final trained model with satisfactory performance.
- A zipped dataset containing synthetic images generated via Dreamina for testing purposes.

All scripts and resources are organized to allow reproducibility and experimentation with minimal setup.

## üîç Objective

- Apply AI tools to streamline code development, image generation, and scientific writing.
- Evaluate the effectiveness and limitations of AI-generated code in training deep learning models.
- Analyze the impact of synthetic data on classification performance.

## üõ† Tools Used

- **Claude & DeepSeek**: For automatic generation of Python training scripts.
- **Dreamina**: For generation of synthetic dermatoscopic images.
- **Quillbot**: For improving clarity and fluency of scientific writing.
- **HAM10000 dataset**: Real dermatoscopic images used for training and evaluation.

## üìÇ Dataset

- A filtered subset of the [HAM10000 dataset](https://doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2018.161) was used, focusing on two classes:
  - `nv` (benign nevi)
  - `mel` (malignant melanoma)

## üß™ Methodology Overview

1. Prompted AI models to generate training code using PyTorch and Keras.
2. Trained and evaluated the models on the filtered HAM10000 dataset.
3. Generated synthetic images using Dreamina based on class prompts.
4. Augmented the dataset with synthetic data and retrained the model.
5. Analyzed results using confusion matrices, accuracy/loss curves, and classification metrics.

## üìà Results Summary

- Code generated by Claude and DeepSeek failed to generalize correctly without human guidance.
- A custom-tuned model achieved **~76% accuracy** on real data.
- Synthetic data improved generalization marginally (up to **60% accuracy**) but with noticeable class imbalance.
- Human oversight was essential in correcting flawed AI assumptions.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

- Models trained from AI-generated code suffered from architectural issues (e.g., predicting only one class).
- Synthetic images lacked visual fidelity compared to real data.
- Small dataset size and binary classification limit real-world applicability.

## üí° Future Work

- Expand to multiclass classification covering all HAM10000 categories.
- Use higher-quality generative models for synthetic image creation.
- Integrate explainability techniques (e.g., Grad-CAM) to analyze model decisions.
- Validate with larger, real-world datasets.
